1: original hash function: 438.72
2. new hash function: 0.05640976359792438
3. Bad hash functions make it so that the table needs to rehash often because of more collisions occurring. Good hash functions (and therefore perfect has functions) reduce the amount of collisions and cut down on the amount of times that rehashing needs to be done.
